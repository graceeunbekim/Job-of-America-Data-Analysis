Using the previous 'min_max_average_salary' function, we conclude that 'senior research scientist (near-surface phenomenology)' is the highest average salary. Thus, we can't assume that it is unpopular because the average salary is low."

We found that 'senior research scientist (near-surface phenomenology)' is located in Vicksburg, Mississippi by grouping job titles by locations. We won't be able to conclude if this is because the location is unpopular (less applicants). We discovered we need to collect more data of each applicant to advance the analysis. Coincidentally, applications during the period might be away from Vicksburg, Mississippi, and that caused the position to be less noticed. However, this analysis confirm that there is no correlation on locations and job titles."

      "Based on the sample code above in the 'Find Least Popular Job' section, we can use the function 'leastPopularJobs' to determine top five (or we need a set of threashhold to determine a numeric value of least popular jobs in the list). Then, we can do followings with the return value:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When an applicant does research on a job, we return data from the least popular jobs to the most popular jobs to fill out unpopular jobs quickly. Making dicovery rate higher for unpopular jobs enables the applicants to see them first and it adds higher chance of getting applicants.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. To further increase relevance for job searching yet maintain to return unpopular ones first, we grab cookies from an applicant A who is currently searching, find the location of A, and run a function that matches with the location of A and the locations of the unpopular jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. We can even take this further by adding a field 'miles'. For instance, an applicant can add how many miles they are willing to commute or relocate from their current location. We implement a function to calculate the distance between the location of the applicant and the locations of the unpopular jobs and return only the ones fall into the range the applicant input at the beginning of the search.\n",

      "4. Other simple improvement we can do is, to advertise what we found as unpopular jobs with the 'lestPopularJobs' method on somewhere job listings of the website."
