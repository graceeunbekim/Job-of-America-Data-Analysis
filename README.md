# Why Ipython ?
Ipython is a fantastic tool for data analysis, collaborating with other brilliant analysts, and sharing the result with others efficiently and effectively.

I first fell in love with Ipython when I took a graduate course at UC Berkeley called 'Open Data'. I met with the creator of Ipython and talked about how he was passionate about data sharing and data science. I decided to dive more deeply into the tool by conducting several small analysis for my side project.

#### Rendering
Ipython is rendered in git repository too. (SUPER COOL!) If you click any .ipynb file, it will automatically detect that this is an ipython notebook and will render beautifully.

However, I still encourage you to share your ipython notebook via nbviewer due to a cut-off layout in a git repository. You can also view the notebook through the nbviewer. If you are using *DataFrame* and printing a data table with lots of columns anywhere in your notebook, git repo will cut it off and you have to scroll right to view the rest of the table. You don't need to worry about any layout, cut-off or distortion issues in nbviewer.

# Data
> I believe that data science is a key to succeed in building any tools. I also strongly believe that we, as a programmer, can help others by conducting analysis using tools like this and turning raw data to something meaningful, readable, and useful.

I chose RESTful API from US job opening by the government. It can be found here [Job openings](https://data.usajobs.gov).

On a side note, go ahead and watch 'How to build a good API and why it matter' by Google
if anyone's interested in digging into this subject.

#### Closing
I'm interested in learning about data visualization, data science and data analysis. If anyone's interested in collaborating data analysis, using public data, to turn raw data into something meaningful and interesting, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to discuss about spending my weekends for making something useful to our communities.
