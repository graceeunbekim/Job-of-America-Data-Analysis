# Why Ipython ?
Ipython is a fantastic tool for data analysis, collaborating with other brilliant analysts, and sharing the result with others efficiently and effectively.

I first fell in love with Ipython when I took a graduate course at UC Berkeley called 'Open Data'. I met with the creator of Ipython and talked about how he was passionate about data sharing and data science. I decided to dive more deeply into the tool by conducting several small analysis for my side project.

#### Rendering
Ipython is rendered in git repository too. (SUPER COOL!) If you click any .ipynb file, it will automatically detect that this is an ipython notebook and will render beautifully.

You can also view the notebook through the nbviewer.

# Data
> I believe that data science is a key to succeed in building any tools. I also strongly believe that we, as a programmer, can help others by conducting analysis using tools like this and turning raw data to something meaningful, readable, and useful.

I chose a RESTful API from US job opening by the government.
